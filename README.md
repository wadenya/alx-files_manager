0x04. Files manager
This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

User authentication via a token
List all files
Upload a new file
Change permission of a file
View a file
Generate thumbnails for images
You will be guided step by step for building it, but you have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etcâ€¦ (utils folder will be your friend)
